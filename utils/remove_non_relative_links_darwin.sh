# The Qt libs are dynamically loaded with rules like: `@rpath/QtGui.framework/Versions/5/QtGui`
# @rpath instructs the dynamic linker to search a list of paths in order to locate the framework
# The rules can be listed using `otool -l "${path_to_binary}"`
# The building process of therecipe/qt or qmake leaves the rules with additional unwanted paths
#   + absolute path to build directory
#   + dummy replacement `/break_the_rpath`
# We need to manually remove those and add the path relative to executable: `@executable_path/../Frameworks`
