## Manual greps
# ack  ProtonMail | ack -v rebranding |  ack -v test | ack -v github.com/ProtonMail | ack ProtonMail
# ack Technologies

## GUI: use backend or global var
# internal/frontend/qml/Notifications/Notifications.qml
# internal/frontend/qml/StatusWindow.qml
# internal/frontend/qml/MainWindow.qml
# internal/frontend/qml/WelcomeGuide.qml

## CLI:
# internal/frontend/cli/utils.go
# internal/frontend/cli/frontend.go

## Config (no migration needed)
# internal/imap/server.go -- IMAP ID
# internal/smtp/user.go -- comment
# internal/config/tls/tls.go -- newly created cert only
# cmd/launcher/main.go (sentry)

## App rename and installation paths (might have huge impact on functionality)
# cmd/Desktop-Bridge/main.go -- base
#   - sentry
#   - notifications
#   - autostart
#   - cli.App name
#   - frontend programName
# internal/frontend/share/info.rc
#   - Test it works with icon (is used in release?)
#   - needs re-install
# dist/proton-bridge.desktop
#   - check it works with reinstall, needs reinstall
# internal/locations/locations.go
#   - check it works with reinstall, needs reinstall

## Keep unchanged
# internal/constants/constants.go:23 for locations provider
