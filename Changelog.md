## [Bridge 1.2.5] Charles - live (2020-03-11) beta (from 2020-02-10)

### Added
* GODT-112 Migration of preferences from c10 to c11.
* GODT-100 Test for external internal ID when appending to Sent folder to return APPEND UID otherwise skip with no error.
* GODT-43 Connection troubleshooting modal.
* GODT-55 Uid support in fake api.
* GODT-88 Increase uid validity on switch mode.
* #951 Implementation of IMAP extension UIDPLUS.
* #964 New store package, see Changed section.

### Removed
* MOVE IMAP extension due to missing interaction with UIDPLUS.

### Changed
* GODT-88 Run mbox sync in parallel when switch password mode (re-init not user).
* GODT-95 Do not throw error when trying to create new mailbox in IMAP root.
* GODT-75 Do not fail on unlabel inside delete.
* #1095 always delete IMAP USER including wrong pasword.
* Unique pmapi client userID (including #1098).
* Using go.enmime@v0.6.1 snapshot.
* Better detection of non-auth-error.
* Reset `hasAuthChannel` during logout for proper login functionality (set up auth channel and unlock keys).
* Allow `APPEND` messages without parsable email address in sender field.
* #1060 avoid `Append` after internal message ID was found and message was copyed to mailbox using `MessageLabel`.
* #1049 Basic usage of store in SMTP package to poll event loop during sending message.

* #1046 Fix removing mailbox counts.
* #1048 For any message build error return custom message.
* When event loop exits with error it logs out user from Bridge.
* #953 #984 First label messages before unlabeling when moving messages.
* Fixes after refactor:
    * Slight memory optimization.
    * #1043 do not stuck in loop for updating message which does not exist anywhere anymore.
    * #1034 fix UID dynamic range for empty list.
    * Fix of sequence number in IMAP IDLE expunge during deleting messages.
    * #1030 #1028 Fix some crashes and bad auths.

    * Fix of sequence number in IMAP IDLE expunge during deleting messages.
    * Fix not-returning empty result for UID dynamic range as said in RFC.
    * Separated IMAP to store and IMAP.
    * Store is responsible for everything about db and calls to pmapi, including event loop, sync, address mode.
    * IMAP is responsible only for IMAP interfaces.
    * Event loop is only one per ProtonMail account (instead of one per alias).
    * It also means only one database per account (instead of one per address).
    * Changing address mode is not destroying database, only buckets with IDs mapping (keeping metadata for account).
    * Before first sync we set event ID so we will not miss changes happening during sync.
    * Thanks to previous point we are not starting new sync when we finish first one because of unprocessed events.
    * Sync is not blocking event loop (user can get new messages even during sync).
    * Sync is not blocking reading operations (user can list mailboxes even before first sync is done).
    * Sync is not blocking writing operations such as mark messages read/unread and so on.
    * Most operations have to be passed to API and only event loop is writing them to the database.
    * Avoid relying on counts API endpoint; use event counts as much as possible.
    * Separate function for storing message content type and header into database.
    * Sequence number optimised for last item in mailbox.
    * Allow sending IMAP idle update to timeout to avoid blocking bridge.
    * Synchronisation will create a label if not yet present.
    * Labels and Folders (including system folders) are stored in DB together with their counts for offline read-out.
    * AddressIDs for all user addresses are stored in DB.
    * IMAP updates channel is set when an IMAP client connects (and IMAP updates are dropped until then).
    * DB keeps track of address mode (split/combined).
* Event loop starts as soon as user is initialised (i.e. logged in), not just when imap is connected.
* Use pmapi v1.0.13.
* Logout user if initialisation fails.
* Send UserRefreshEvent on user login and logout.
* Use godog v0.8.0 under new name 'cucumber' (instead of DATA-DOG).

### Fixed
* CSB-40 panic in credential store.
* Keyring unlocking locker.
* No panic on failed html parse.
* Too many open files.
* #1057 Logging in to an already logged in user would display unrelated error "invalid mailbox password".
* #1056 Changing mailbox password sometimes didn't log out user.
* #1066 Split address mode can not work when credentials store is cleared.
* #1071 Bridge can think it is in combined mode when actually it's in split mode.
* Missing `enmime` dependency.
* Issue where a failed sync was not attempted again.
* Removing an address would crash bridge.
* #1087 Accounts with capital letters could not be added.
* #1087 Inactive addresses were not filtered out of the store.
* #1087 Unlock with correct key if message is sent to alias and not primary (aka original) address.
* #1109 Receiving an event referencing an address that isn't present could crash bridge.
* Avoid concurrent map writes in imap backend.
* GODT-103 User keys were not unlocked later if they were not unlocked during startup.
