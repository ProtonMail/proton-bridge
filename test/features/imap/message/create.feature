    And there is IMAP client logged in as "userMoreAddresses"

  Scenario: Creates message to user's primary address

    When IMAP client creates message "foo" from "john.doe@email.com" to address "primary" of "userMoreAddresses" with body "hello world" in "INBOX"
    Then IMAP response is "OK"

    Given there is IMAP client selected in "Sent"
    When IMAP client creates message "foo" from "notuser@gmail.com" to "alsonotuser@gmail.com" with body "hello world" in "Sent"
    Then IMAP response is "OK"

  # Importing duplicate messages when messageID cannot be found in Sent already.
  #
  # Previously, we discarded messages for which sender matches account address to
  # avoid duplicates, but this led to discarding messages imported through mail client.
  #
  # NOTE: We need to introduce cooldown here in order to detect duplicates
  # properly. Once mail is imported to API the Sphinx indices for duplicate
  # detection are updated every 10s. Therefore it is good to leave at least 15
  # second gap after import in order to be able to correctly handle the case
  # when we try to detect duplicate imports
  Scenario: Imports a similar (duplicate) message to sent
    Given there are messages in mailbox "Sent" for "userMoreAddresses"
      | from      | to             | subject        | body                |
      | [primary] | chosen@one.com | Meet the Twins | Hello, Mr. Anderson |
    And wait for Sphinx to create duplication indices
    And there is IMAP client selected in "Sent"
    Then mailbox "Sent" for "userMoreAddresses" has 1 messages
    When IMAP client creates message "Meet the Twins" from address "primary" of "userMoreAddresses" to "chosen@one.com" with body "Hello, Mr. Anderson" in "Sent"
    Then IMAP response is "OK \[APPENDUID 4 2\] APPEND completed"
